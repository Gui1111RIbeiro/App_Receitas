# Project Description

This project was developed as part of my study on the flutter framework. I was curious how to develop a mobile app, so I started to study and develop many apps to improve. In this project I made an app with recipes to make and follow the same by filters or just see your favorites. I learned a lot about navigating between screens and how to use a database along with the application
